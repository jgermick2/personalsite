# About Me

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I've created this space because I believe there's more to convey about my career interests, passions, and aspirations than what fits on a single-page resume.

Rather than the traditional "cover letter," I find that a personal website offers a more comprehensive and effective platform to articulate what truly motivates me.

Through the various pages of this site, my aim is to provide deeper insights into my goals and motivations. Personally, I'm driven by the pursuit of roles that offer continuous opportunities for growth and facilitate the experience of "flow" â€“ a state of optimal engagement and productivity. These two aspects are deeply intertwined.

While the notion of continuous growth may seem universal, I strongly believe that not all roles inherently foster such development. In many conventional office environments, the emphasis is primarily on getting employees up to speed and maximizing present productivity, often at the expense of exploration and learning. Roles structured in this manner don't genuinely promote meaningful growth opportunities.

On the other hand, the concept of "flow" is highly individualized. Through my own experiences, particularly in programming tasks, I've discovered that the optimal balance between challenge and skill level inherent in such tasks often leads to a state of flow. Tasks like troubleshooting a circuit for a specific output voltage, however, tend to lack this engaging element as they involve mere repetition of known actions.

Within this website, I endeavor to showcase specific experiences that have been truly engaging and have facilitated a flow state for me, as well as those that have not. This way, readers can gain a better understanding of what drives my professional satisfaction.
