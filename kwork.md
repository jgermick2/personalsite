# Work Experience in Reverse Chronological Order

## United States Patent and Trademark Office - Patent Examiner

Since late 2020, I've served as a Patent Examiner, specializing in examining patents concerning Artificial Intelligence and Quantum computing software technologies. This role has been a departure from my previous experiences.

In a typical week, I handle 2-5 "actions," which are legal documents prepared in .docx format to assess the patentability of specific patent applications in the aforementioned areas. My responsibilities include reviewing applications to determine their eligibility for patent protection and conducting extensive research to ensure the uniqueness of the described inventions.

This involves crafting evidence-based arguments regarding the semantic interpretation of phrases and words within technical documents, emphasizing logical analysis over conventional engineering problem-solving. Additionally, I've taken the initiative to learn VBA to streamline the documentation process due to the volume of actions required.

Personally, I find pleasure in engaging in discussions about the nuances of language, a trait that aligns well with this role. However, while it offers stability and work-life balance, it lacks the elements of growth and flow that I seek in my career.

## International Business Machines (IBM) - Signal Integrity Engineer

My initial role after completing my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering was as a Signal Integrity Engineer at IBM, focusing on electronics for interfacing with quantum computers.

As a Signal Integrity Engineer, I was responsible for ensuring the proper transmission of electrical signals through circuits, a task that demanded a deep understanding of electromagnetism to mitigate interference. While I found certain aspects of the role, such as the following tasks, to be engaging:

- Developing Python and Bash scripts to interface with lab equipment for data transmission and analysis.
- Creating a Python GUI for streamlined testing processes, saving considerable time for fellow engineers.
- Writing Bash scripts for log file parsing and managing test data.
- Conducting stress tests on computer boards using multithreaded Python scripts.

However, it became evident that troubleshooting circuit boards and mastering simulation tools constituted the core responsibilities of a Signal Integrity Engineer. The programming tasks mentioned above were only neccessary for certain specific tasks. I realized then that only a subset of tasks seemed to lead to flow state I value in my work.

## University of Minnesota Auditory Perception and Cognition Laboratory - Research Assistant (REU)

During the final summer of my university studies, I worked in an interdisciplinary lab focused on auditory perception research, leveraging MRI technology.

In this role, I applied my engineering background to process fMRI data, adapting existing techniques to suit our experimental needs. The experience was enriching, prompting me to continue working on the project beyond the summer term.

## Iowa State University Magnetics Lab - Research Assistant (REU)

Through a university partnership with the University of Cardiff in Wales, I conducted research on simulating the electrical effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on neurons.

This involved utilizing finite element software to model magnetic pulse activation on human skulls. My involvement extended beyond the summer term, culminating in presentations at conferences and a published paper in IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.

While working with simulation tools involved a significant amount of tedious work, my role offered ample room for experimentation. I delved into various avenues, including exploring methods for automating object placement and explored the latest software and techniques for preprocessing fMRI data.

## International Paper - Reliability Engineering Internship

During this internship at a paper manufacturing plant, I gained valuable insights into the realm of manufacturing and process engineering. My responsibilities often revolved around conducting root cause analyses for machine failures. Operating within an aging plant environment, I encountered frequent instances of equipment failures or indications of imminent failure on a nearly daily basis.

At the same time, one of my primary tasks entailed digitizing information about industrial components. It quickly became apparent that the fast-paced and unpredictable nature of the workplace was unlikely to ever facilitate the state of "flow," and certainly left little room for researching or exploring new methods. While this trial-by-fire style role offered numerous opportunities to learn from failure, it only addressed one of the key aspects I sought in a career.

## Rochester Institute of Technology - Research Assistant (REU)

My first internship involved applying image processing techniques to analyze musical data, specifically automated transcription of music.

This experience allowed me to delve into self-directed learning, including teaching myself Linear Algebra. It solidified my belief in the capacity for independent learning and its inherent enjoyment.
