# About Me

Hi, 
Thanks for taking the time to learn about me. I created this site because I have more to say about my carear interests, passions and goals than a single page resume can provide.

I believe that portal is a more efficient and useful method of describing what drives me that the conventional "cover letter".

The general message I want to convey is that I am truely driven by being given an oppertunity to challenge myself and dive into an unfamiliar field. My dream job is something like a "generalist IT guy" who is able to research an implement modern technological solutions to create efficiency gains within an organization. I believe that most, if not all business have numerous oppertunities for "automation" to save countless man hours. Such businesses do not implement these solutions because they are simply unaware of the cost/benefit or even existance of such solutions. Here are some canonnical basic problems I beleive many companies have but don't even know they exists or that relatively simple solutions exist.
- Document management and digitization
- Automated control of equipment and machinery 
- realtime monitoring and recording of system state (camera's and image processing)
