        <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>I consider myself to be an active learner. Even without compensation, I enjoy challenging myself to learn new things. Here are some examples:</p>

<h2 id="website-development">Website development</h2>

<p>After graduating University, I taught myself HTML/CSS/Javascript. I used such knowledge to make sites like this one, as well as a cooking website to catalogue family recipes. This led me to learning about automated site generators like “Jekyll” and more sophisticated technologies like python-flask for generating dynamic websites.</p>

<p>For example, I created a local website for tracking data related to my house plants such as hydration state, ph, and light intensity. I also  automated control of light state and watering via a smart outlet and solenoid valve attached to a pump. While this was a fun project, I found it more enjoyable and engaging to monitor my plants without a computer.</p>

<h2 id="python-scripting">Python scripting</h2>

<p>As noted in my work experiences, I have used python for many scripting tasks. Outside of work I have found it useful to learn how to scrape data from the internet. I wrote scripts to scrape data from websites about garden plant care, musical meta data, and google patents.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have written python scripts for automating financial porfolio rebalancing as well as computing taxes.</p>

<p>This has kept more programming skills up, despite not using them much for my current job.</p>

<h2 id="chat-gpt">Chat GPT</h2>

<p>With the advent of Chat GPT, programming has gotten even more interesting. I taught myself VBA almost entirely from asking Chat GPT to generate code and then continuing to ask it how and why certain behaviors occured when trying to implement the code.</p>

<h2 id="self-hosting">Self Hosting</h2>

<p>I love the idea of hosting my own websites. There is so much information online about how to do this and it is an endless source of learning. I host via Docker a services for VPN, file management, music playing, note keeping, cooking recipes, classic video games, and ebooks.</p>

<p>This has led me to a deeper understanding of how the internet works as well as a practical understanding of the security concerns related to sending data over the internet.</p>
