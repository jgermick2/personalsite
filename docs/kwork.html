<h2 id="united-states-patent-and-trademark-office---patent-examiner">United States Patent and Trademark Office - Patent Examiner</h2>

<p>Since late 2020, I have worked as a Patent Examiner, examining patents covering Artificial Intelligence and Quantum computing software technologies. This job has been quite different from any prior experiences I have had.</p>

<p>A typical week involves preparing 2-5 “actions”, which are legal documents formatted in .docx to address the patentability of particular patent applications in the areas mentioned above. To prepare such documents, I review the applications to see if they qualify under specific legal requirements as theoretically eligible for a patent, then I read/search for any patent documents or public documents (such as research papers available through Google Scholar) to see if the described invention already exists.</p>

<p>Naturally, such tasks involve making evidence based arguements about the “semantic” meaning of phrases and words, in practice, this is a “legal” analysis of the meaning of words in technical documents rather than arguments about the technical efficacy of a solution. This is an exercise in logical argumentation rather than a conventional engineering problem solving.</p>

<p>Further, this role has inspried me to learn VBA to automate the writing process, given that I am tasked with writing so many actions.</p>

<p>I have also enjoyed engaging in arguments/discussions about the meaning of words and phrases, particularly when trying to understand the rules of board games with friends and family. So this role has been a good fit for me.</p>

<h2 id="international-business-machines-ibm---signal-integrity-engineer">International Business Machines (IBM) - Signal Integrity Engineer</h2>

<p>My first job after completing my Bachelors of Science in Electical Engineering (See Transcript), was as a Signal Integrity Engineer working on electronics for interfacing with quantum computers.</p>

<p>A Signal Integrity Engineer is tasked with ensuring that electrical signals (power or data) traveling through a circuit are actually moving as expected by designers. This requires a deep understanding of electromagnetism because electrical signals, especially those traveling at high speeds, are subject to numerous sources of interference. This generally involves an iterative processes of simulation and validation on physical hardware.</p>

<p>Personally, learning and using simulation tools (HFSS, SPICE and PowerDC) was tedious and un-interesting to me. However, I particularily enjoyed working with all sorts of sophisticated lab equipment to diagnose issues with circuit boards. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrote computer code (Python + Bash) to interface with several pieces of lab equipment over serial ports and ethernet ports (VNAs, oscilliscopes, power supplies etc.) to send highf-requency data (3-6 Ghz) through a circuit and measure the responses, finally a report was automatically generated to assess the performance of the circuit.</li>
  <li>Created a python GUI available over the local lab internet so that other engineers could interact directly with a existing test circuit, which previously required engineers to toggle a series of switches and buttons directly on the circuit by hand. This took less than a week and saved the engineers countless hours of manual testing on a product that existed for years.</li>
  <li>Several quick Bash scripts for parsing and fetching log files from various other projects on the team.</li>
  <li>A python script written to run over multiple threads to stress test the boot times of a particular computer board which was reported to have a rare bug.</li>
  <li>Using python to automate steps of the simulation setup so that they would not have to be done by hand every time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="university-of-minnesota-auditory-perception-and-cognition-laboratory---research-assistant-reu">University of Minnesota Auditory Perception and Cognition Laboratory - Research assistant (REU)</h2>

<p>During the last summer of my university studies I worked in an interdisplinary lab, mostly of psychology graduate students, which studied how humans percieved sound through the use of MRI machines. MRI data is inherently  complicated, in order to process such data accurately the data must be post-processed based on the design of a particular experiment. For example, 4d volume of data, which is a representation of the 3d volume of a human brain over time, must be filtered of noise and modulated based on particular timings such as when a musical tone is heard while a participant is in the MRI machine.</p>

<p>In this role, I had the opportunity to apply my engineering background to a new problem by researching current practices for processing fMRI data, and modifying such practices to be applicable to our particular experiments.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the experience so much that I continued working on the problem during the following semester.</p>

<h2 id="iowa-state-university-magnetics-lab---research-assistant-reu">Iowa state University Magnetics Lab - Research assistant (REU)</h2>

<p>Through a University partnership with the Universtity of Cardiff in Wales, I spent a summer abroad in Wales doing research simulating, in finite element software (SIM4LIFE), the electrical effects of activating neurons in the brain with magnetic pulses (known as transcranial magnetic stimulation).</p>

<p>This involved placing a custom designed “coil” in software over a software representation of real human skulls. The project was to compare the activation properties of different “coil” designs on identical samples of skulls.</p>

<p>After this summer, I continued working 10 hours a week on this project until graduation. This led me to presenting my work at conferences such as APS (the American Physical Society) as well as publishing a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8421086">paper</a> in IEEE transactions on Magnetics.
Near the end of my degree, I used my remaining time to explore automation of the simulation setup.</p>

<h2 id="international-paper---reliability-engineering-internship">International Paper - Reliability Engineering Internship</h2>

<p>This role was a more typical engineering internship at a manufacturing plant. I had the opportunity to understand what it would be like to work full time in the “manufacturing world”. I participated in team “fact finding missions”, known as root cause analysis, to determine why such industrial machines failed, and how to prevent the failure in the future.</p>

<p>The largest project I had was simply to digitize information about industrial components around the factory which was only available via visual inspection of the components “on the ground”.</p>

<p>After this role I decided “manufacturing” was not a good fit for my interests.</p>

<h2 id="rochester-institute-of-technology---research-assistant-reu">Rochester Institute of Technology - Research assistant (REU)</h2>

<p>This was my first “internship” experience. The project given to me by my PI was to attempt to apply image processing methods to musical analysis. In particular, automated transcription of music.</p>

<p>I explored many techniques and applied them using Matlab. This was a fun an engaging first research experience, it allowed me to truly explore what I could learn and accomplish when a task is given my full attention.</p>

<p>I spent a significant chunk of the 10 weeks simply teaches myself Linear Algebra, which I had not yet taken in school. After this experience, my spirit was cemented with the idea that if given enough time I could learn anything without explicit guidance by a teacher. Not only could I learn anything, but I learned this process is quite enjoyable.</p>
