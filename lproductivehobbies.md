# Summary 

I consider myself an avid learner, driven by curiosity rather than compensation. Here are a few examples of my pursuits:

## Website Development

Upon graduating from university, I delved into self-learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript, crafting websites ranging from this one to a platform dedicated to family recipes. This journey introduced me to automated site generators like "Jekyll" and advanced technologies like Python-Flask for dynamic websites.

One project I particularly enjoyed involved creating a local website to monitor my houseplants' health metrics such as moisture levels, pH, and light intensity. I automated tasks like controlling light states and watering through a smart outlet and solenoid valve, although I ultimately found joy in manually tending to my plants.

## Python Scripting

My professional experiences have often required Python scripting, extending beyond my job to personal projects. I've honed skills in web scraping, extracting data from sources ranging from gardening advice websites to patent databases. Additionally, I've developed Python scripts for tasks like financial portfolio management and tax computation, ensuring my programming abilities remain sharp despite their limited use in my current role.

## Chat GPT

Exploring the realm of Chat GPT has added another layer of excitement to programming. I taught myself VBA through interactive sessions with Chat GPT, leveraging its insights into code generation and behavior to deepen my understanding. I'm willing to wager that you wouldn't guess that the majority of this site was actually proofread using Chat GPT.

## Self Hosting

The idea of hosting my own websites captivates me, serving as an ongoing learning journey. By experimenting with containerization and hypervisor tools, I've integrated diverse open-source software components to host VPNs, file managers, media players, and more. This exploration has not only enhanced my understanding of internet infrastructure but also provided practical insights into data security concerns associated with online communication.
